                    <p>AWC, short for Association for Women in Computing is also a 
                     professional organization, but is dedicated to supporting women
                     and non-binary people in Computing and Technology.

                         AWC has not only helped me find the importance of equity and 
                         diversity, but also a community of people in my field 
                         who I can relate to, and enjoy spending time with.

                     <p>I also was able to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration in 
                         Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which Celebrates Women in Computing
                         from across the nation. I met so many brilliant women, and it 
                         truly inspired me to not let anyone put down my talent as a 
                         programmer because of my gender.

                    oSTEM, short for Out in Science, Technology,

                    is a professional organization dedicated to celebrating and promoting diversity

                      I also had the pleasure of attending the National oSTEM Conference 
                      in Boston, Massachusetts in 2022. I learned so much about inclusion,
                      leadership, and community, and the keynote speakers were inspiring. 
                      I hope to attend another conference someday, as it was truly a 
                      lifechanging event.
