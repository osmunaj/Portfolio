                <h1>Before College</h1>
                <p>I was born in Washington, but grew up in Colorado. As a kid, I played soccer
                    with my brother, and was an active member in band as a trumpet player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first coding experience was in 8th grade. We used Scratch, 
                    a Block Based visual programming language, used to design video games.
                    I had so much fun, I decided I wanted to code for a living.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Highschool, I took a couple coding classes before deciding to
                    major in Computer Science in college. I took multiple AP courses, including
                    Computer Science Principles, Computer Science, Statistics, and Calculus BC. 
                    I have always had a passion for math, logic, and problem solving.

                <h1>My Interests</h1>
                <p>In my freetime, I like to play videogames & Dungeons and Dragons,
                    cooking, digital art, and music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always enjoyed coding things that go hand-in-hand with my 
                    interests, so many of my coding projects are related to DND or 
                    creating my own video games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I try to use my creativity and design skills in my everyday
                    life, including my coding projects.

                <img src="/images/ari-senior-trumpet.jpg" class="image" alt="">
                <p>Band has always been a significant part of my life. I started playing the trumpet 
                    in 5th grade, and have been playing ever since. It really helps me express
                    myself in an artistic manner, as well as stay physically active, and has 
                    always been one of my favorite outlets.

                <p>In High School I played in a competitive marching band,
                    as well as performed and soloed as a jazz musician.
                    I even won the Louis Armstrong Jazz Award.

                    At Montana State, I play in the Spirit of the West marching
                    band, where we perform at football games and play in a pep 
                    band to bring energy to our team. Band will always have a place
                    in my heart, and I strive to bring my energy and passion for Band
                    into every aspect of my life.

                <p>Most of my art I do in my freetime, but I made the cloud piece
                    in a drawing class I took!
                    It really helps me express myself and just be creative
                    while relaxing!
