                <h1>Before College</h1>
                <p>I was born in Washington, but grew up in Colorado. As a kid, I played soccer
                    with my brother, and was an active member in band as a trumpet player.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first coding experience was in 8th grade. We used Scratch, 
                    a Block Based visual programming language, used to design video games.
                    I had so much fun, I decided I wanted to code for a living.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During Highschool, I took a couple coding classes before deciding to
                    major in Computer Science in college. I took multiple AP courses, including
                    Computer Science Principles, Computer Science, Statistics, and Calculus BC. 
                    I have always had a passion for math, logic, and problem solving.

            <section class="stylized_section">
                <h1>My Interests</h1>
                <p>In my freetime, I like to play videogames & Dungeons and Dragons,
                    cooking, digital art, and music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've always enjoyed coding things that go hand-in-hand with my 
                    interests, so many of my coding projects are related to DND or 
                    creating my own video games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I try to use my creativity and design skills in my everyday
                    life, including my coding projects.
